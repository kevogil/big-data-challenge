# Big Data Homework - "Alexa, can you handle big data?"

## Background

Many of Amazon's shoppers depend on product reviews to make a purchase. Amazon makes these datasets publicly available. The datasets are quite large and can exceed the capacity of local machines to handle. One dataset alone contains over 1.5 million rows; with over 40 datasets, this can be quite taxing on the average local computer. By leveraging AWS, we can perform an ETL (extract, transform, load) process entirely in the cloud.

A list of the various product review datasets can be found at the link below:

## Datasets
For this project, we will be creating a dataframe of Amazon customer reviews from various office and health/personal care products.
